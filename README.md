# Health-BOT
The Health Bot project is a machine learning-based system designed to assist users in identifying potential health conditions based on their symptoms and X-ray images.
The chatbot is equipped with natural language processing (NLP) technology, which allows it to interpret users' messages and respond appropriately. Users can input their symptoms into the chatbot, and the system will provide them with a list of potential health conditions that match their symptoms. The chatbot will also ask follow-up questions to refine the list of potential conditions further.

In addition to symptom-based diagnosis, the Health Bot project also includes a feature for analyzing X-ray images. Users can upload their X-ray images to the chatbot, and the system will analyze the images to identify if the user has pneumonia, tuberculosis, or malaria. The system uses CNN to analyze the X-ray images, and the results are displayed to the user within seconds.

Overall, the Health Bot project aims to provide users with a convenient and accessible way to identify potential diseases and seek appropriate medical attention. Following the potential risk detection users are also guided to nearby hospitals to seek proper medical care .
